## Learning Python from the book “Python Express”

Welcome to my project dedicated to learning Python based on the book “Python Express"!
In this repository you will find materials and exercises that will help you master the basics of the Python programming language.

### What will you find in this project?:
1. **The source codes of the examples from the book:** All the examples presented in Python Express have been carefully translated and commented for a better understanding.

2. **Additional exercises and tasks:** To consolidate the material, I have added a few additional tasks and exercises so that you can practice.

3. **Problem solving:** In this section you will find solutions to the proposed tasks so that you can compare your answers and understand how to solve complex problems.

4. **Useful resources and links:** Links to useful online resources, forums, and additional literature for further study of Python.


### How to get started:
1. **Download or clone this repository:** Use your preferred method to get the project files.

2. **Read the introduction:** Familiarize yourself with the initial materials and the structure of the project.

3. **Study and experiment:** Take lessons, complete assignments, and compare your solutions with those offered.

4. **Ask questions and share ideas:** If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to write them in the comments or create issues.

### Useful tips:
1. **Practice regularly:** The more you write code, the better you will understand the language.

2. **Use an interactive Python shell:** python or ipython for quick testing and experimentation with code.

3. **Join Python communities:** Participate in forums and groups such as Python Discord to share experiences and receive help.
